# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-
This project applies deep learning techniques to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was designed and trained to categorize MRI images into four classes:  Glioma  Meningioma  Pituitary  No Tumor
